🧠 Digit Recognition Model
Welcome to the Digit Recognition project! This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model designed to recognize handwritten digits.

🚀 Project Overview
This project is focused on building a predictive system that identifies digits from input images. The system leverages a trained model to make predictions based on the pixel data of the images.

📂 Files and Directories
Digit_Recognition.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
input_image.jpg: A sample image used for testing the model's prediction capabilities.

🛠️ How It Works
Image Input: An image of a digit is loaded and preprocessed.
Model Prediction: The preprocessed image is fed into a pre-trained model to predict the digit.
Output: The predicted digit is displayed as the final output.

🔧 Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-recognition.git

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Digit_Recognition.ipynb

📊 Model Performance
The model is trained to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits from handwritten images. The performance metrics will be displayed during the model evaluation phase within the notebook.
